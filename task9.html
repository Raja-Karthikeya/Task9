                RS Academy was conceived by Darren Cox, former Nissan Europe executive, in 2006 to help Sony PlayStation racing gamers become professional racing drivers. A small event was held in 2006 in a partnership with Sony, where participants competed in the Gran Turismo game and on an actual track for a Nissan 350Z prize.Cox saw the speed in real cars of the gamers and his idea of 'Gamer to Racer' was born.
